# Competitive Analysis Framework

## Quick Assessment Matrix

| Factor | Your Product | Competitor A | Competitor B |

| Core Feature | | | |
| Price | | | |
| Target User | | | |
| Distribution | | | |
| Differentiator | | | |

## Porter's Five Forces (Simplified)

### 1. Existing Competitors
- **Direct**: Same problem, same solution
- **Indirect**: Same problem, different solution
- **Key Question**: How crowded is the space?

### 2. New Entrant Threat
- Low barrier = high threat
- Consider: Technical complexity, capital requirements, network effects

### 3. Substitute Products
- What alternatives exist outside your category?
- Example: Notion vs physical notebooks vs sticky notes

### 4. Buyer Power
- Many alternatives = high buyer power
- Switching cost low = high buyer power

### 5. Supplier Power
- API dependencies (OpenAI, AWS, etc.)
- Platform dependencies (App Store, Chrome Web Store)

## Differentiation Strategies

### 1. Feature Differentiation
- Unique capability competitors lack
- Risk: Easily copied

### 2. UX Differentiation
- Better design, simpler flow
- Risk: Subjective, hard to communicate

### 3. Price Differentiation
- Cheaper or free tier
- Risk: Race to bottom

### 4. Niche Focus
- Serve specific segment extremely well
- Example: "Project management for design agencies"

### 5. Integration Ecosystem
- Work with tools users already use
- Example: Slack, Notion, Linear integrations
