### Hacker News
- **Best time**: 8-9 AM ET, weekdays
- **Title**: Keep factual, no marketing speak
- **Show HN** vs regular post
- **Be ready** to answer questions fast

### Reddit
- **Find right subreddit**: r/SideProject, niche subs
- **Don't spam**: 1-2 posts max
- **Engage genuinely**: Answer all comments
- **Flair**: Follow subreddit rules exactly

## Common Launch Mistakes

- Launching on Friday/weekend
- No analytics = blind launch
- Landing page not converting
- Too many bugs at launch
- Not responding to feedback fast
- Over-promising features
- Ignoring negative feedback

## Minimum Viable Launch

If time-constrained, prioritize:
1. ✅ Product works for core use case
2. ✅ Payment flow works
3. ✅ Landing page exists
4. ✅ One launch platform
5. ✅ Error monitoring active

Everything else can come after initial traction.
